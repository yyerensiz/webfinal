            <p>At the dawn of a new era of cinematography, when online platforms for watching
              movies became increasingly popular, a virtual arena with the name "Senema"

          <div id="item-1-1">
            <h5>Chapter 1</h5>
            <p>The story of "Senema" began with two friends, Alibek and Yryskeldi. They have
              always been big fans of cinema and dreamed of creating something unique in this
              field. Both of them were tech geeks and knew that the future of cinema was

          <div id="item-1-2">
            <h5>Chapter 2</h5>
            <p>Their idea was to create a platform that would unite moviegoers from all over the
              world in a single online cinema. They wanted people to be able to watch movies,
              discuss them and share their impressions without leaving home. And so, in 2018,
              Alibek and Yryskeldi started working on their project.

            <p>The path from idea to reality was long and difficult. Alibek and Yryskeldi first
              studied the technical aspects of creating an online platform and attracted

          <div id="item-3">
            <h4>Chapter 4</h4>
            <p>To launch their project, they needed to attract funding. They made a presentation
              of their idea to investors and convinced them of the prospects of Senema.
              Investors saw the potential of this platform and provided funds for its
              development</p>
          </div>
          <div id="item-3-1">
            <h5>Chapter 5</h5>
            <p>Since the launch of Senema, the platform has been gaining popularity among
              moviegoers. Thousands of users came to the site every day to enjoy a diverse
              catalog of films. Senema provided access to new releases, classic masterpieces,
              and even independent films that were hard to find on traditional movie sites.

          </div>
          <div id="item-3-2">
            <h5>Chapter 6</h5>
            <p>However, what made Senema really special were the social functions. Users could
              create their own profiles, add friends and discuss movies in real time using chat
              and comments. This allowed people to feel as if they were sitting in the same
              cinema, even if the distance between them was thousands of kilometers.</p>
